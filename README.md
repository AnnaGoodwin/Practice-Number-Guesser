# Number-Guesser

Number Guesser is a two-player game where each player makes a guess until they guess the computer-generated random number. Each time a player makes a guess, the screen indicates if their guess is too high, too low, or correct. Each time someone wins, a new card is displayed declaring the winner, and the minimum and maximum ranges change to raise the stakes. This is a fun game to build and hone practice with HTML, CSS and lots of javaScript logic. Enjoy!
